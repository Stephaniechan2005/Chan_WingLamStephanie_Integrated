        <p>
          To do a lot or do nothing at all? A tough decision when almost
          everything is included in one package. No matter what time of year,
          there's always a lot to do at Couples Resort. Then again, who said you
          couldn't just relax in a deep padded chaise lounge on your own room
          deck and indulge in a favorite novel while resting in the soothing
          warmth of the day. Whatever you choose, you're sure to enjoy all of
          our activities.

          The resort sits on a Semi-Private Lake, Galeairy Lake which is 11 km
          long reaching into Algonquin Park and 95% undeveloped so great for
          exploring hidden bays and exploring what nature has to offer along the
          shorelines. Or explore the rugged surroundings can compel you to take
          a guided trail ride in the Algonqin wilderness. With with direct
          access to 35 km of trail alongside the serene Madawaska River on an
          abandoned railway bed you can go mountain biking or ATVing for hours.
          Or take a leisurely hike on the resorts trails.

          Summer in Algonquin Park comes later than surrounding areas as a
          result of the Park's higher elevations.

          <br />We provide free passes into Algonquin Park with your stay with
          us.
          <br />

          and go on a guided trail ride. For those with an appetite for the
          outback, grab your old jeans and head off into the wilderness. There
          is nothing quite like exploring the Algonquin wilderness on horseback

          <br />
          <br />An important form of transportation for the Algonquin natives
          has always been the use of canoes on the beautiful lakes and rivers.
          Canoes and kayaks permit you to travel deep into Algonquin Park on our
          Galeairy Lake still as pristine as ever.
