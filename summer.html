        <p>
          To do a lot or do nothing at all? A tough decision when almost
          everything is included in one package. No matter what time of year,
          there's always a lot to do at Couples Resort. Then again, who said you
          couldn't just relax in a deep padded chaise lounge on your own room
          deck and indulge in a favorite novel while resting in the soothing
          warmth of the day. Whatever you choose, you're sure to enjoy all of
          our activities.
        </p>

          The resort sits on a Semi-Private Lake, Galeairy Lake which is 11 km
          long reaching into Algonquin Park and 95% undeveloped so great for
          exploring hidden bays and exploring what nature has to offer along the
          shorelines. Or explore the rugged surroundings can compel you to take
          a guided trail ride in the Algonqin wilderness. With with direct
          access to 35 km of trail alongside the serene Madawaska River on an
          abandoned railway bed you can go mountain biking or ATVing for hours.
          Or take a leisurely hike on the resorts trails.

          Summer in Algonquin Park comes later than surrounding areas as a
          result of the Park's higher elevations.

          us.
          <br />
          <br />Algonquin Park's two museums, the Visitor Centre and Logging
          Museum, are open daily (see the Events Calendar for specific operating
          dates and hours) offering all visitors park information, plus
          outstanding natural and cultural history exhibits.
          <br />
          <br />Algonquin Park's interpretive walking trails are available for
          day hiking outings. Trails are open year-round, but trail guide
